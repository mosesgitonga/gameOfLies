                            <li><strong>Player 1:</strong> "X"</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>Players take turns placing pieces until all three are placed.</li>
                        <li>Once all pieces are placed, players can <strong>move their pieces</strong> to adjacent empty spaces.</li>
